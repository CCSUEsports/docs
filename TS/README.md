# Troubleshooting Help
This will cover general issues and how to resolve them.

## OBS Crashed!
DONT CLICK ANYTHING! Verify the stream is still running, if it is, leave it and pretend you didnt see it. If it stoped, then restart OBS and start the stream back up.
## I got signed out of Twitch!
You should have recieved the login information as well as how to get the two factor code. Sign back in using that information.
## There are no Scene Collections or Profiles!
The computer may have been wiped, it happens from time to time. Head over to [Setting up OBS](/setup.md).
## The stream isnt showing the game!
Head over to "OPS | GAME" scene and verify the window being captured is correct.
## My problem isnt listed!
